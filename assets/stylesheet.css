I'm so sorry! I'm just seeing this now I was having  lunch/dinner
GeOwego — Yesterday at 9:28 PM
No problem at all.
My head is pounding!  It mostly was a pathing issue.
GeOwego — Yesterday at 9:35 PM
For some reason when I run a password from the github account it still isn't giving the password at the end.  Im going nutso!  lol
Nina — Yesterday at 9:48 PM
were you able to fix it with Eli?
so the code in your github not the same one in your local?
GeOwego — Yesterday at 9:49 PM
It's the same.  Clarence said it was fixed but I think he was looking at the local file or copy pasting.  The deployed page isn't working properly.  I am going to wait a couple hours and try again as it may just be behind.  Fingers crossed.
Nina — Yesterday at 10:19 PM
I can help you with that on break
GeOwego — Yesterday at 10:19 PM
Im seriously getting twisted over this.  I need to just calm down.
Nina — Yesterday at 10:29 PM
yes just don't worry about it you still got time
Nina — Yesterday at 10:44 PM
is that for which project
I don't see the image in the html file
Nina — Yesterday at 10:52 PM
so i see it in the css
GeOwego — Yesterday at 10:52 PM
Because it's a hero image (Background banner) they are typically placed in the css stylesheet.  Also, I know it works because it's fine when run locally.
Nina — Yesterday at 10:54 PM

GeOwego — Yesterday at 10:54 PM
