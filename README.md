# code-interview-quiz

## Description:

A quiz based on common coding interview questions. The user has 60 seconds to answer 5 questions and as a penalty for wrong answers time is taken off the clock.

## How it works:

On startup the user is able to begin answering questions and attempt to answer as many as possible before time runs out.  At the end of the quiz the user can input their initials and track their high scores which will mantain a running list of said scores on a separate page which displays the list.
